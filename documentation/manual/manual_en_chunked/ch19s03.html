Tips on Editing Instruments</h2></div></div></div><p>With all of the different parameters available to tweak, it can be
       difficult to set up something that sounds nice when you're done.  Here are 
       a few tips on setting up an instrument:</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Turn down the gain.</strong></span> Every gain
       knob (i.e. an amplifier), this is a <span class="emphasis"><em>gain stage</em></span>.  
       With every gain stage you have, it's
       easy to overdrive your signal - which means the signal gets
       distorted by <a class="link" href="go01.html#def.clipping" title="Clipping">clipping</a>.  In addition, if you have two samples that, by
       themselves, peg your meters - what do you think happens when you
       combine them?  That's right, you overdrive the signal again.</p><p>If things sound bad and distorted, start by turning down the gain
       setting on the layer... especially if it's larger than 1.0.  Then turn
       down the instrument gain.  Then any gain on a <abbr class="abbrev">LADSPA</abbr> effect.  Then the
       fader on the Mixer.  Then the master output fader.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Test samples at full velocity.</strong></span>
       Your sample will be played louder if the velocity is higher.  So, if you
       set everything to sound nice and full with velocity at 0.7, what will
       happen when you get a full velocity of 1.0?  (<span class="emphasis"><em>Hint:
       <a class="link" href="go01.html#def.clipping" title="Clipping">clipping</a>.</em></span>)</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Try to use samples that are -6 dB
       max.</strong></span> Visually, this means samples that peak at only
       1/2 of full scale.  Otherwise, turn your layer gain to about
       .5.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Remove all DC offsets from the
       sample.</strong></span> In a sample editor, there is usually a line down the
       center of your sample's waveform.  This is the zero-line.  The beginning
       of your sample should be on this line.  The end of your sample should
       also be on this line.  However, if your signal is a little above or a
       little below this line, you will hear a click at the beginning and the
       end of your sample whenever it is played.  If your sample editor doesn't
       provide any tools to fix a DC offset problem, you can eliminate the
       noise by putting a slight fade-in/out at the ends of your sample.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>The ADSR will not be longer than your
       sample.</strong></span> If you have a short sample, it doesn't matter how
       long you set the attack and delay - the sample will stop playing
       at the end.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Things change with the sample
       rate.</strong></span> If you have a really nice setup with all your
       parameters painstakingly tweaked... things <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span>
       change if you change the sample rate of your audio card.  Many of
       Hydrogen's internal settings and parameters are based on how many
       samples go by, not on how many seconds go by.  The sorts of things
       that change are: anything time-base (like attack and release) and
       anything frequency based (like the cutoff frequency).</p><p>
         Typical samples that are used in Hydrogen are: the sound of a single
         drum hit, the sound of a single cymbal hit, the sound of a single
         cowbell hit.  Whenever you put a note in the pattern (or play a note
         using <abbr class="abbrev">MIDI</abbr>), Hydrogen will play whatever sound you have loaded.  So,
         to put together a drum kit you need to gather short recordings of the
         bass drum, each tom, each cymbal, the high hat open, the high hat
         closed, the snare drum (snare on), the snare drum (snare off), rim
         shots, etc.
       </p><p>
         However, there are no rules about what a sample can be.  It's not
         uncommon to use Hydrogen to trigger non-drum sounds like: audio clips
         of people talking, a clip from a song, sound effects, audio clips from
         movies, and famous people speaking.  Be creative!
